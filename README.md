# Todo
This Todo app is a full-stack program built to showcase certain languages, frameworks, and design patterns.
A live example can be found at [Jacob-Webb.com/todo](https://jacob-webb.com/todo).
To see the backend portion of the Todo program, visit [Jacob-Webb/todos-backend](https://github.com/Jacob-Webb/todos-backend).

## Todo/frontend
This frontend portion was built using Angular 11, is styled using Angular Material, and utilizes reactive programming using the RxJS library. 

### [Angular Material Framework](https://material.angular.io/)
Angular Material was chosen as the styling framework for this project simply as a substitute for [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Most of my other projects are built with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and I wanted to make something that looked a little more unique.

### [Reactive Programming](http://reactivex.io/)
RxJS was incorporated to help with reactive programming. The two main uses for reactive programming in this app were for asynchronous calls to the backend api and for allowing multiple components in the app to listen for changes to local storage variables and to react accordingly.
